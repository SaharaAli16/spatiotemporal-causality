## Abstract
Spatiotemporal data, which captures how variables evolve across space and time, is ubiquitous in fields such as environmental science, epidemiology, and urban planning. However, identifying causal relationships in these datasets is challenging due to the presence of spatial dependencies, temporal autocorrelation, and confounding factors. This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to spatiotemporal causal inference, offering both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for researchers and practitioners. We explore key concepts such as causal inference frameworks, the impact of confounding in spatiotemporal settings, and the challenges posed by spatial and temporal dependencies. The tutorial covers synthetic spatiotemporal benchmark data generation, widely used spatiotemporal causal inference techniques, including regression-based, propensity score-based, and deep learning-based methods, and demonstrates their application using synthetic datasets. Through step-by-step examples, attendees will gain a clear understanding of how to address common challenges and apply causal inference techniques to spatiotemporal data. This tutorial serves as a valuable resource for those looking to improve the rigor and reliability of their causal analyses in spatiotemporal contexts.
